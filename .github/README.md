Things that need to be changed when a new branch is created:
- in merge.yml, the branch name needs to updated for the new one;
- also in merge.yaml, the `VERSION` variable needs to be updated for the particular build;
- the `SLACK_CHANNEL` env variable might also have to be changed to another value - probably in all workflow yaml files;
